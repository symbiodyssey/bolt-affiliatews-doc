Install Bolt CM
===============

Bolt CMS is not made to serve multiple website, but it does not mean that you cannot install multiple times bolt on the same server. Therefore, this tutorial can be followed as many times as you want on the same server, every website would be installed in parallele.

It has been tested on Debian 9 (stretch)

Create a new database
#####################

We need a database to store the data of your new website such as your items, categories, the users to admin and edit, ...

The good news is that we have a script for that...

Type the following command to download the script on the server : ::

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/symbiodyssey/bolt-affiliate-template/master/install/createMysqlDataBase.sh

Give it the right to be executed : ::

	chmod +x createMysqlDataBase.sh

Execute it : ::

	./createMysqlDataBase.sh

The script will ask you a few questions :

#. A name for the new database, we recommand you to use this pattern : if your domain name is example.com set the name as : com_example
#. The username of the administration of Mysql. normally it is root
#. The password of this user, you have created it in the previous article, I hope you can remember it.

The script will generate a new user and password for the new database, please remember them as you will need it during the next step (and in the future):

Configure Nginx
###############

In this step we are going to tell Nginx, your web server that if someone connects to your website with your domain what the user should be served. The answer is a page generated by Bolt installed in a specific directory. Bolt CMS is made with PHP a script language for the web.

To connect all of those actors, we have a script for you.

This command will download the script : ::

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/symbiodyssey/bolt-affiliate-template/master/install/install-nginx-site.sh

Give it the right to be executed : ::

	chmod +x install-nginx-site.sh

And execute it : ::

	./install-nginx-site.sh

The script will ask you one question, what is your domain name. Use this pattern to answer : example.com

Last step, reload nginx as we have created a new file with this command : ::

	systemctl reload nginx

Install Bolt and the template
#############################

Final step, if you're here, congratulations, you overcame the two first monsters, DataBaseZilla and NGinxKong :D

No time to fall asleep as Bolty Krueger is waiting for you to make it a nightmare... But  we are here to help you overcome this one as well.

As you would guess, let's download the script : ::

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/symbiodyssey/bolt-affiliate-template/master/install/install.sh

give it the right to be executed : ::

	chmod +x install.sh

And execute it : ::

	./install.sh

You will be asked a bunch of questions :

#. Your name, to start with a simple step
#. The title of your website as it will appear on the top of your website. For instance "Great Border Bridges" if you are specialized in building bridges at country borders.
#. Your domaine name with this pattern : example.com
#.	Your database name as you have set it, if you have follower our recommandation it should be something like com_example
#.	The username of the database, should be something similar to usr_com_example
#.	The password of this user, unfortunately we don't know, it has been given you at the beginning of this article
#.	The folder where to install bolt, use /var/www, this is the most common folder and what our script has set for you in the previous step
	
Hopefully everything will work well for you.

If it is the case you should be able to see something if you access your domain name in your browser.

You can also access access the dashboard by typing : ::

	http://your-domain.com/bolt
	
Of course, replace your-domain.com by your real domain name.

If it works fine, you can be proud of you, you have overcome the last monster, you have setup an affiliate website. Now you should take a break before editing your website.
